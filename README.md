# Some of my work

Below are some of the work I have done that can be shared publicly without affecting company or customer interests.

## Backtest a Bollinger Band Strategy
I built a backtester to evaluate the profitability of a basic Bollinger Band trading strategy. This project allowed me to apply statistical analysis to quantify strategy performance across different markets and time periods. While more refinement is needed, it's a solid proof-of-concept.

## Macroeconomic Analysis and Market Outlook
In this weekly report, I synthesize global macro events, policy shifts, and industry trends to formulate an outlook on equities, fixed income, currencies, and commodities. I blend top-down fundamental analysis with bottom-up technicals for robust market insights.

## Semi-automated Technical Analysis and Signals
Using Amibroker (AFL), FireAnt, and Excel, I developed a workflow to automatically generate technical analysis charts, indicators, and trading signals for thousands of stocks. This allows me to quickly surface opportunities while eliminating manual effort.
