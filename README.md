# Some of my work

Below are some of the work I have done that can be shared publicly without violating company or customer interests.

## Backtesting and Optimizing Trading Strategy

I have experience building and evaluating quantitative trading strategies through robust backtesting and optimization techniques. The sample project below provides a demonstration of this process, though it requires further refinement and statistical validation before it could be considered a viable strategy. Please note this analysis is for educational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice. I do not make any representations regarding its profitability or appropriateness for trading purposes.

## Macroeconomic Analysis and Market Outlook
In this weekly report, I synthesize global macro events, policy shifts, and industry trends to formulate an outlook on equities, fixed income, currencies, and commodities. I blend top-down fundamental analysis with bottom-up technicals for robust market insights.

## Automated Technical Analysis and Signals
Using Amibroker (AFL), FireAnt, and Excel, I developed a workflow to automatically generate technical analysis charts, indicators, and trading signals for thousands of stocks. This allows me to quickly surface opportunities while eliminating manual effort.

## Fundamental Analysis and Financial Modeling
I produce regular reports analyzing financial statements, valuation, competitive positioning, and other factors to complement my technical analysis. This provides a comprehensive view of investment prospects and risks.
